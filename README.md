## Ring Interface
The Ring interface is a structure that consists of a set and 2 operations, being addition and multiplication. 
Our Ring interface contains methods that can provide the zero additive property and multiplicative property, as well
as basic addition and multiplication within a ring.

### Methods
T zero(): returns additive identity of the ring

T identity(): returns multiplicative identity of ring. 

T sum(T x, T y): takes 2 elements and returns their sum

T product(T x, T y): takes 2 elements and returns their product

### Usage
To use our Ring interface, we have implemented 3 classes to use it: IntegerRing, DoubleRing, and BitIntRing. 
Each of these classes contain implement the Ring functionality with respect to its respective data type.
